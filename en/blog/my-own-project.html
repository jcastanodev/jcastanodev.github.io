            It's been 15 years since I wrote my first line of code. I remember that at the age of 12 I was already fascinated by the world of programming. It all started as a simple interest, but it quickly turned into a passion. It took me to study Systems and Computing Engineering, where, even before graduating, I was developing for a company.

            Today, November 16, 2024, I find myself reflecting on the journey: all the functions, the views, the classes, the data structures, the languages, and the countless tools that have passed through my hands. Over these 15 years, most of my code production has been for clients, large and small, and not for myself.

            It's funny and sometimes frustrating. Creating something of my own has always been a dream, but I never took it seriously until recently. Today I have a personal project that motivates me, although it's not where I want it to be yet. Progress has been slow, and frustration hits hard, especially when I think about all that still needs to be done.

            But these years have taught me something important: software projects can last decades. They develop and evolve over time, and that's okay. Even with imposter syndrome lurking and artificial intelligence advancing by leaps and bounds, I try to use these modern tools to my advantage. I convince myself that, thanks to today's technology, creating something truly impactful is more achievable than ever.
